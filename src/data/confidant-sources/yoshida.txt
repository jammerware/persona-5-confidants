Arcana: Sun
Name: Yoshida
Location: Shibuya Station Square at night
Rank 1:
This cooperation can be picked up from 5/6 onwards, but is entirely optional and easy to miss for months. Yoshida can be found in Station Square, but if you listen to his political preaching you'll learn that he frequents a nearby Beef Bowl Shop.
You can apply to work there via the leaflets in the train station. Work there twice and you'll meet Yoshida, starting off this confidant cooperation.
